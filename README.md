Till now I'm just working on the user management functionalities, and I still need to finish the update user function.
after that I'll find a real project to work on it.
if you have any suggestions please tell me and I'll be more than happy to hear from you.
I added like a to-do list app, after the user logs in he can create, update, view, or delete items.
and here is a screenshot from swagger also
